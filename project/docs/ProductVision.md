## Product Vision

### Vision Statement

For FEUP members who need an easier way to manage their group meetings, the UNI Group Manager is a Group and Event creation system that promotes the creation and management of work teams through a fully intuitive student search bar and an updatable friends list, as well as a group builder with a built-in event scheduler that will facilitate interacting with your team.
